# Python Discord Bot

The purpose of this Discord Python bot was to use the public Discord.py API and library. The project was made two years ago as a small side project to test my capabilities with Python. The bot is currently inactive and has not been updated to utilize the current latest Discord.py library.

### Main Features of this Bot:
- Music Player via FFmpeg library
- Profanity Detector
- Fun User Commands (such as 8ball or a game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- Console that prints out user messages and actions
